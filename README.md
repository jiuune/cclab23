# juneCClab

here you can see my code: [https://github.io/jiuune/cclab23] and this is the live version on GitHub Pages:

https://jiuune.github.io/cclab23

this is the root, or very base of my cclab folder 

if you see this on a URL that looks like 

jiuune.github.io/cclab23

then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to get to the actual webpages
